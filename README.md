# Loans Prediction Project

This project aims to build an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting loan outcomes. The focus is on developing production-grade solutions with a strong emphasis on the following areas:

## Project Features

- **Production-Grade File Structuring and Packaging**: Organize code and resources in a scalable and maintainable manner, adhering to best practices for file structuring and packaging.

- **Production-Grade Code**: Ensure code quality through best practices, such as modularity, readability, and maintainability.

- **Model Training with MLflow**: Utilize MLflow for experiment tracking, model management, and reproducibility of results.

- **Code Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.

- **Flask API Development**: Build a robust Flask API to serve the trained machine learning models, facilitating seamless integration with other systems.

- **Productionizing ML Models**: Optimize and prepare machine learning models for deployment in a production environment.

- **CI/CD Implementation with Jenkins**: Leverage Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment, automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

- **Monitoring with Prometheus**: Monitor model performance and system health using Prometheus, ensuring the deployed models operate as expected.

- **Deployment with Docker and Kubernetes**: Containerize the application using Docker and orchestrate deployment with Kubernetes for scalable and reliable deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking and model management
- **Flask**: API development
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and logging
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loans-prediction.git
   cd loans-prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required dependencies.
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure MLflow**:
   Set up MLflow tracking URI and experiment details.

4. **Run Tests**:
   Execute the test suite to ensure everything is set up correctly.
   ```sh
   pytest tests/
   ```

5. **Train the Model**:
   Run the model training script using MLflow.
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
   ```

6. **Deploy the Flask API**:
   Start the Flask API server.
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Containerize with Docker**:
   Build and run the Docker container.
   ```sh
   docker build -t loans-prediction .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 loans-prediction
   ```

8. **Deploy with Kubernetes**:
   Apply the Kubernetes deployment configurations.
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

## Monitoring

Prometheus is configured to monitor the deployed application. Access the Prometheus dashboard to visualize metrics and ensure the application is performing as expected.
